  <li> 1 Diced Plum Tomato (optional) </li>
  <li> Shredded Parmesian Cheese </li>
  <li> 1 Tablespoon of Butter </li>
  <li> Olive Oil </li>
  <li> 1/4 lb. of Ground Beef </li>

  <h2 class="background"> Step 1 </h2>
  <p> Boil water and make sure to add salt and olive oil! Many people forget to do this step, but it is vital
    for the flavor of the pasta.</p>

<h2> Step 2 </h2>
<p> Add spaghetti to the boiling water, and cook for about 8-10 minutes (the longer you cook, the more tender it will be).
  At the same time, begin making the sauce and meat in separate pots and pans. </p>

<h2 class="background"> Step 3 </h2>
<p> Put a jar of tomato sauce into a pot and set the stove temperature to medium-low. Add a tablespoon of butter, a handful of parmesean cheese, one garlic clove,
  half a cup of red wine, lemon juice from 1/2 of a lemon, and salt & pepper to taste (optional: add diced plum tomato). At the same time, begin to cook your ground beef in a pan and set the stove temperature to medium.
  Add a tablespoon of olive oil, one garlic clove, and salt & pepper to taste. Once your meat is cooked, add it to the sauce pot and change the stove setting to low.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>
<p> Drain the pasta out of the bowl and do NOT rinse the pasta in the sink! Rinsing the pasta will make the pasta stick together and, more
  importantly, will cause a loss in flavor. Add parmesian cheese and olive oil to the pasta once it's drained. </p>

  <h2 class="background"> Step 5 </h2>
  <p> Mix the pasta with the sauce while the stove is still on a low setting. This will allow the flavors to simmer together and it won't be as
    messy as having two separate bowls at the dinner table. </p>
